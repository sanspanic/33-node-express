# Broken App Issues

1. rewrote let and var into const
2. inserted print statement into app.listen
3. added error handling
4. added middleware to parse JSON
5. rewrote async callback inside map - using promises and promise.all instead
6. renamed unclear variables such as "d" and "out"
7. returning res.json instead of res.send
